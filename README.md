The preview note you provided is mostly clear and accurate, but there are a few improvements that can be made for better clarity and grammar. Here's a revised version:

Throughout this project, we will be utilizing various Data Definition Language (DDL) commands, such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, to create, modify, and drop the sample_book database and its related tables (employee, project, department, and works_on). The data for the sample_book database is sourced from the book "Microsoft SQL Server 2016: A Beginner's Guide," Sixth Edition, by Du≈°an Petkovic.

Additionally, we will employ Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands such as INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, and DELETE to populate the database, retrieve data, perform updates, and more.

Finally, we will migrate the sample_book database from pgAdmin4 to Azure Data Solution using PostgreSQL and Azure Data Studio.
